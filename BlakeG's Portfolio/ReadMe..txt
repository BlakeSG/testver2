Blake Gillanders Portfolio page.

Blake Gillanders Portfolio page is my personal portfolio page that I have created for my web504 assignment currently it only implements HTMl and CSS code but Javascript will be added for functionality
soon as I learn more skills. On my webpage you will find information about me and my life iswell as list of my skills that I have gained through work or life experiances. you will also be able
to find my completed projects from study or personal life. 

The webpage is pretty easy to use theres 4 main pages "home, Skills, projects and contact me" they can each be accessed via the navigation bar at the top of the page.
If you wish to get in contact with me simply visit the "contact me" page and select one of the many contact methods./.

Thanks for visiting my github repository.
You will notice my portfolio folder is setup in a very simple way each website page has its own folder containing the contents of the page which includes the HTML page containing all of the main code
a css style sheet with all the css code relevant to the page and all the attached images that are on the page

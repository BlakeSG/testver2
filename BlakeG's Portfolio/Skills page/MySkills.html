                    <div class="Web502"><li><h1 class="section-title">Coding languages</h1><p class="section-description">In July 2023, I embarked on a rewarding coding journey, 
                        beginning with a solid foundation in HTML and CSS to craft the very website you are currently exploring. Over this period, I've developed proficiency in
                         these languages, allowing me to design aesthetically pleasing websites and maintain well-organized, easily readable code. My ability to incorporate animations 
                         and transitions has added an engaging dimension to my web development skills.

                        While my CSS skills have matured, I acknowledge that I'm still in the early stages of mastering this language. Nevertheless, the rapid strides I've made 
                        in a short span of time have bolstered my confidence, and I remain eager to further expand my expertise.
                        
                        Simultaneously, I've delved into JavaScript, dedicating several weeks to learning its intricacies. While I'm presently crafting simple functions, 
                        my sights are set on developing more intricate features, such as enhancing the website's usability with advanced functions like search features. JavaScript's
                         versatility and power continue to captivate me, motivating my ongoing learning journey.
                        
                        In addition to these languages, I've ventured into the world of MySQL, primarily to create databases for projects in my DAT class. This diversification of 
                        my skill set underscores my commitment to mastering a wide spectrum of technologies and languages, ensuring that I remain adaptable and well-prepared for 
                        the dynamic landscape of IT and programming. </p></li> </div>
                    <div class="Web502"><li><h1 class="section-title">Certifications</h1><p class="section-description">Over the course of my three years in the workforce, I've proactively pursued certifications and licenses that have enriched my skill set and enhanced 
                        my on-the-job capabilities. One notable certification I hold is the OSH forklift certification, which I've maintained for the past two years. Through practical experience in
                         various work settings, I've honed my forklift operation skills, demonstrating both precision and safety awareness.

                        Additionally, I've acquired a Class Two truck license, a testament to my commitment to professional growth. This license was obtained through practical training with 
                        'Van and a Man,' and I've amassed several months of hands-on driving experience, further refining my proficiency.
                        
                        These certifications and licenses not only reflect my dedication to continuous learning but also underscore my ability to apply these skills effectively in real-world 
                        scenarios. </p></li></div>
